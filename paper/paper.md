# Summary
PLEIADES is a Python-based code designed to streamline and simplify the process of neutron resonance transmission analysis using the R-matrix code SAMMY. PLEIADES acts as a user-friendly wrapper that automates the setup, execution, and analysis of SAMMY files and is specifically tailored for extracting isotopic densities based on SAMMY fits of spatially-resolved neutron transmission spectra on a pixel-by-pixel basis. The PLEIADES source code is available from GitHub. PLEIADES comes with a [readthedocs](https://pleiades-sammy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) page that includes comprehensive documentation, including API documentation and usage examples/notebooks.
